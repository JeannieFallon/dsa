# dsa: Data Structures & Algorithms

[Professional Certificate: Data Structures and
Algorithms](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/gtx-data-structures-and-algorithms)

The Georgia Institute of Technology (GTx)

- Learn how to differentiate between linear data structures like linkedlists, arrays, arraylists,
  stacks, and queues, and select the correct structure for a given situation. Analyze data structure
  performance with the course visualization tool.
- Visualize and study nonlinear/hierarchical data structures such as Binary Trees, BSTs and Heaps.
  Examine tree operations & algorithms. Implement a HashMap that uses key-value pairs to store data.
  Explore probabilistic data structures like SkipLists.
- To differentiate between complex tree data structures, like AVL and (2-4) trees, understand their
  self-balancing techniques and implementations. Visualize and examine various Divide and Conquer
  sorting algorithms along with their performance.
- Analyze & implement various Pattern Matching algorithms from KMP to Rabin-Karp. Study essential
  graph traversal algorithms in order to implement Dijkstraâ€™s Shortest Path, and construct Minimum
  Spanning Trees. Delve in Dynamic Programming.

**Note**: Although the course is taught in Java, solutions here will be rewritten in C.
